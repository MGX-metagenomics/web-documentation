## About

<div style="text-align: justify">

The characterization of microbial communities based on sequencing and analysis of their genetic information has become a popular approach also referred to as metagenomics; in particular, the recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to study even the most complex communities.  

Metagenome analysis, the assignment of sequences to taxonomic and functional entities, however, remains a tedious task: large amounts of data need to be processed. There are a number of approaches addressing particular aspects, but scientific questions are often too specific to be answered by a general-purpose method.

We present `MGX`, a flexible and extensible `client/server-framework` for the management and analysis of metagenomic datasets. `MGX` features a comprehensive set of adaptable workflows required for taxonomic and functional metagenome analysis, combined with an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical user interface offering customizable result visualizations.

At the same time, `MGX` allows to include own data sources and devise custom analysis pipelines, thus enabling researchers to perform basic as well as highly specific analyses within a single application. With `MGX`, we provide a novel metagenome analysis platform giving researchers access to the most recent analysis tools. 

`MGX` covers taxonomic and functional metagenome analysis, statistical evaluation and a wide range of visualizations easing data interpretation. Its default taxonomic classification pipeline provides equivalent or superior results in comparison to existing tools.
