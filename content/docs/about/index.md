## About

<div style="text-align: justify">

The characterization of microbial communities based on sequencing and analysis of their genetic information has become a popular approach also referred to as metagenomics; in particular, the recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to study even the most complex communities.  

Metagenome analysis, the assignment of sequences to taxonomic and functional entities, however, remains a tedious task: large amounts of data need to be processed. There are a number of approaches addressing particular aspects, but scientific questions are often too specific to be answered by a general-purpose method.

We present `MGX`, a flexible and extensible `client/server-framework` for the management and analysis of metagenomic datasets. `MGX` features a comprehensive set of adaptable workflows required for taxonomic and functional metagenome analysis, combined with an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical user interface offering customizable result visualizations.

At the same time, `MGX` allows to include own data sources and devise custom analysis pipelines, thus enabling researchers to perform basic as well as highly specific analyses within a single application. With `MGX`, we provide a novel metagenome analysis platform giving researchers access to the most recent analysis tools. 

`MGX` covers taxonomic and functional metagenome analysis, statistical evaluation and a wide range of visualizations easing data interpretation. Its default taxonomic classification pipeline provides equivalent or superior results in comparison to existing tools.

## Demo
If you want to try out MGX 2.0, we offer two public demonstration projects:

> `MGX2_Demo` contains sequence data from the black band disease study previously [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240343/) by Sato et al. that was used as a demonstration example in the upcoming MGX 2.0 publication; ENA project accession [PRJNA321354](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA321354). 

> `MGX2_TermiteGut` with metagenome and metatranscriptome date from the well-known termite gut study; ENA project accession [PRJNA454696](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA454696).

To access these example projects, download the MGX 2.0 application and log in with username `mgxdemo` and password `mgxdemo`. Please note that only read access is permitted here, _i.e._ you can explore all precomputed results and inspect the assemblies, but wont be able to initiate new analyses or delete existing data.
